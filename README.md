# ConnectHub

## The Idea of the Project
ConnectHub is a lightweight social networking platform that allows users to create posts, follow other users, and engage with content through likes. The application includes user authentication, a personalized feed, and dynamic post editing using JavaScript and the Fetch API. It replicates core features of modern social media platforms in a minimal and functional design.

## The Features
- User registration, login, and logout
- Create new posts with a live feed update
- View all posts in a global feed, or view only posts from followed users
- Follow and unfollow other users
- Like and unlike posts with real-time updates
- Edit own posts directly from the feed using AJAX
- Paginated post listing with clean layout
- Dynamic page behavior using JavaScript Fetch and DOM updates

## What I Have Learned
- Integrated Django backend with a JavaScript-powered front end
- Used Fetch API and JSON responses to create asynchronous user experiences
- Implemented liking and editing functionality with real-time UI updates
- Handled user relationships (followers/following) through Django models
- Developed pagination and user-specific content rendering
- Improved skills in combining Django views, templates, and frontend scripting
